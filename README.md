# Grand Schemes

A list of my project ideas, most obsolete. Some are designed properly and golden, others from experience or to learn.

Do not wish to share because the code is either a competitive advantage (potential for income) or disadvantage (too horribly unmaintained as a solo project).

## Idiomatic Hello Worlds

* [codebreaker](https://github.com/ryjen/codebreaker): hello rust via "mastermind" game

* [challenges](https://github.com/ryjen/challenges): pulling coding challenge emails into a repository
* [writing a custom shell](https://github.com/ryjen/os/tree/master/shell): and other OS stuff like scheduling and paging

## MUDs

Whenever I want to learn or practice a new framework, language or design method.... I make a mud.

MUDs are simple games without graphical interfaces, but none-the-less include interesting things to develop:

* client/server networking
* database and data access
* scripting, game logic and pathfinding
* command/interpreter and other design patterns
* world editors
* protocol conformance like telnet,ssh,ansi color

---

* [arthea](https://github.com/ryjen/arthea): *earth in pig latin* with javascript parser for scripting (C#/.NET/MongoDB/NUnit)
* [mudharbour](https://github.com/ryjen/mudharbour) for web and [Jmud](https://github.com/ryjen/jmud) server/client/editor (Java/Hibernate/JEE)
* [muddled](https://github.com/ryjen/muddled): very old project, somewhat vulnerable to sqlinjection (C/SQLite)
* [dlm](https://github.com/ryjen/lost-cause): an attempt at adding raytracing to a mud (C++)

## Other

* yubi key auth for git
* generic service or api aggregator with cache
* a project generator and build tool:  integrates with git, aws, versioning, migrations, and docker.  has modules for:
    - makefile build system
    - frontend (gulp/node,modern html template)
    - backend (golang with templates and security)
    - mobile (react,flutter)
